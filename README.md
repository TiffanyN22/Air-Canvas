# Air Canvas
## About
This repository includes code for a Flask website for Air Canvas. The Air Canvas works by detecting the user's hand gestures and using that to allow them to draw on a canvas.  It also includes features such as palm to switch to an eraser, fist to switch back to the brush and change to any rainbow color, thumbs up to increase the brush size, and thumbs down to decrease the brush size.  The website also allows the user to upload an image to serve as the background for the canvas instead of their webcam, and includes information on programs used and project timeline.  A full video demo of the website and Air Canvas can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/LtaKtEGQQrY)!
